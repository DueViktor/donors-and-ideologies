# Donors And Ideologies

The code for my elective project, supervised by Michele Coscia.

## How to use

[scripts/littlesis-graph-exploration.ipynb](scripts/littlesis-graph-exploration.ipynb) is a good place to start if you want to explore the data.

## Data

All data is stored in the `data` folder.

[littlesis](https://littlesis.org/) is a database of connections between people and organizations. I use the entities.json and the relationships.json files to create a graph of the connections between people and organizations.

[data/voteview-HS117_members.csv](data/voteview-HS117_members.csv) contains the ideology scores for the members of the 117th House of Representatives taken from [voteview.com](https://voteview.com/).
